What is PyQwt ( http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net ) ?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a 2-dimensional plotting widget and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, and optionally NumPy or SciPy
  in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- it plots fast: fairly good hardware allows a rate of 100,000 points/second.
  (PyQwt with Qt-3 is faster than with Qt-4).

- it is licensed under the GPL with an exception to allow dynamic linking
  with non-free releases of Qt and PyQt. 


The most important new features of PyQwt-5.1.0 are:
- support for Qwt-5.1.0.
- support for PyQt-4.4.2 and SIP-4.7.6.
- support for Qt-4.4.
- the CartesianDemo.py, MaskedDataDemo.py, PickerDemo.py examples.

The most important bug fixes in PyQwt-5.1.0 are:
- fixed QwtPicker::stateMachine() to allow for subclassing of QwtPicker in
  Python.

PyQwt-5.1.0 supports:
1. Python-2.5, or -2.4. 
2. PyQt-3.17.
3. PyQt-4.4, PyQt-4.3, or PyQt-4.2.
3  SIP-4.7, or SIP-4.6.
4. Qt-3.3, or Qt-3.2.
5. Qt-4.4, Qt-4.3, or Qt-4.2.
6. Qwt-5.1, or Qwt-5.0.
7. Recent versions of NumPy, numarray, and/or Numeric.
