What is PyQwt ( http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net ) ?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, and optionally NumPy or SciPy
  in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- it plots fast: displaying data with 100,000 points takes about 0.1 s.

- it is licensed under the GPL with an exception to allow dynamic linking
  with non-free releases of Qt and PyQt.
