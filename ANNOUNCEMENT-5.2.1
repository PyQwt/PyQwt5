What is PyQwt ( http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net ) ?

- It is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a 2-dimensional plotting widget and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- It requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- It supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, and optionally NumPy or SciPy
  in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- It runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- It plots fast: fairly good hardware allows a rate of 100,000 points/second.
  (PyQwt with Qt-3 is faster than with Qt-4).

- It is licensed under the GPL with an exception to allow dynamic linking
  with non-free releases of Qt and PyQt. 


The most important new features of PyQwt v5.2.1 are:
- Support for Python-3.1.
- Support for PyQt upto v4.7.4, PyQt upto v3.18.1, and SIP upto v4.10.4.
- Support for Qwt v5.2.1.
- Added a custom scale example.

The most important bug fixes in PyQwt-5.2.1 are:
- Fixed the qwt plugin for the pyuic4 user interface compiler
- Fixed custom scales.
- Worked around a code generation bug in the early versions of SIP v4.10.x. 


PyQwt-5.2.0 supports:
1. Python v3.1.x, v2.7.x, v2.6.x, and v2.5.x.
2. SIP v4.10.x.
3. PyQt v3.18.x.
4  PyQt v4.7.x.
5. Qt v3.3.x.
6. Qt v4.6.x, v4.5.x, and v4.4.x.
7. Qwt v5.2.x, v5.1.x, and v5.0.x.
8. NumPy v1.4.x, v1.3.x, and v1.2.x. Python-3.1 requires NumPy from subversion.
