New features:
- supports the N-D array interface specification: NumPy can be used with
  somewhat reduced functionality when PyQwt has been built without support
  for NumPy. See: http://numpy.scipy.org/array_interface.shtml.
- works with Qt-4.3.0 in combination with SIP-4.7 and PyQt-4.3.
- the iqt module also supports an interactive Python session without the
  help of the GNU readline module.
- one of the QwtPlotPicker::TrackerText() C++ member functions has been renamed
  to QwtPlotPicker.TrackerTextF() in Python for disambiguation.
- the HistogramDemo.py example.
- when anynumpy.py fails to import any numerical Python extension, it pops up a
  message box showing where to get NumPy.
- the latex sources for the documentation (a Debian requirement).

Bug fixes:
- plugs a memory leak in toQImage(anArray).
- builts against an system Qwt library without the QwtSVGItem CONFIG option.
- builts with Python-2.5 and MSVS-2005
- fixed the mouse movement tracking in the BarPlotDemo.py example.
- fixed crashing of MultiDemo.py when a numerical Python extension has been
  installed but PyQwt has not been built with support for that extension.
- includes revision 173 of the Qwt subversion bugfix branch.
