New features:
- supports the N-D array interface specification: NumPy can be used with
  somewhat reduced functionality when PyQwt has been built without support
  for NumPy. See: http://numpy.scipy.org/array_interface.shtml.
- works with Qt-4.3.0 in combination with SIP-4.7 and PyQt-4.3.
- one of the QwtPlotPicker::TrackerText() C++ member functions has been renamed
  to QwtPlotPicker.TrackerTextF() in Python for disambiguation.
- added the HistogramDemo.py example.

Bug fixes:
- plugs a memory leak in toQImage(anArray).
- builts against an system Qwt library without the QwtSVGItem CONFIG option.
- fixed the mouse movement tracking in the BarPlotDemo.py example.
- includes revision 173 of the Qwt subversion bugfix branch.
