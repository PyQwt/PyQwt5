What is PyQwt ( http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net ) ?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
  applications.   It provides a 2-dimensional plotting widget and
  various widgets to display and control bounded or unbounded floating
  point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, and optionally NumPy or SciPy
  in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- it plots fast: fairly good hardware allows a rate of 100,000 points/second.
  (PyQwt with Qt-3 is faster than with Qt-4).

- it is licensed under the GPL with an exception to allow dynamic linking
  with non-free releases of Qt and PyQt. 


The most important new features of PyQwt v5.2.0 are:
- support for Qwt v5.2.0
- support for PyQt upto v4.5.4, PyQt upto v3.18.1, and SIP upto v4.8.2.
- switch to documentation generated by Sphinx.
- provide a normal qwt plugin for the pyuic4 user interface compiler instead of
  the anormal qwt plugin included in PyQt. 

The most important bug fixes in PyQwt-5.2.0 are:
- fixed crashes in the QImage-array conversion functions.
- fixed three transfer of ownership bugs.


PyQwt-5.2.0 supports:
1. Python v2.6.x and v2.5.x.
2. PyQt v3.18.1 downto v3.17.5.
3  PyQt v4.5.x, v4.4.x.
4  SIP v4.8.1 downto v4.7.3.
5. Qt v3.3.x.
6. Qt v4.5.x, v4.4.x, and v4.3.x.
7. Qwt v5.2.x, v5.1.x, and v5.0.x.
8. Recent versions of NumPy, numarray, and/or Numeric.
